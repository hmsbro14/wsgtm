# This is WS-GTM, a open source GTA V mod project
This tool will only work with Legacy GTA V, it **WILL NOT** work with GTA V Enhanced

### GTM ModMenu (Coming Soon...)
This is a trainer for GTA V Legacy story mode that can do the same thing most trainers can do, it was just a random idea that popped up into my head. Coded in python, made into a executable with Pyinstaller, this thing is essential for GTA V Story Mode gameplay!

### GTM Cross.
This specialized GTM module will spoof GTA Online memory to make it think you are on console, but you are actually on PC! It makes the game cross-platform between PC and Xbox Series X|S. Coded in python, made into a executable with Pyinstaller, this thing is essential for GTA Online gameplay!

### GTM Toolkit (Coming Soon...)
This toolkit is GTM Cross and GTM ModMenu combined into one. This was coded in Python, yes.
